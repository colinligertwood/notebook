# Espresso

I'm trying to keep this document up to date with the things that have helped me pull better home espresso. The following only works if you have fresh beans, a burr grinder, and are you're using a single-walled (non-pressurized) basket.

## Dose

* Don't over-dose your basket. If the puck gets stuck to the filter-head when you remove the porta-filter, you've over-dosed. The top of a fully compressed puck should be about a quarter inch below the top of the basket.
* Weigh your whole beans for every pull. I pull an 18 gram double, so I grind 18 grams of beans. My double basket wont fit much more than that.

## Grind

* Tiny hard beans want to be ground finer. Large soft beans want to be ground coarser.
* Finer grinds can achieve more complex flavor, but coarser grinds pull more consistently, so find a balance.

## Grooming & Distribution

This is what you do to settle the coffee into the basket before tamping. Getting this right can help to reduce channeling and will result in a better brew. The idea is to have an even distribution of coffee in the basket before tamping.

* Lightly groom the coffee into the portafilter to form a very loose puck.
* Tap the bottom of the portafilter with your hand, or lightly tap down on the counter to help settle the coffee in the basket.
* Using a distribution tool can help to consistently distribute and level the top.

## Tamping
* Use a palm tamper for consistently level tamps, but don't fret about pressure. Press hard enough to fully compress the puck.

## Brew Ratio

Over-extracted coffee tastes bitter and acrid. Under-extracted coffee tastes sour and hollow. Your extraction should generally take about 25-35 seconds when targeting a ratio of about 1:2. That means for every gram of coffee grounds, you should be yielding about 2 grams of espresso. This will ensure that the water is in contact with the coffee long enough to fully extract the coffee.

## Stir

* Give the espresso a quick stir before drinking to incorporate any grounds or bitter compounds trapped in the crema.

## My own tips

* If you can manually control the timing of pre-infusion, pre-infuse until the coffee starts to pour smoothly out of both spouts. If you can't get a satisfactory flow under low pressure, consider reducing your dose or using a coarser grind.
* If you want to pull decaf beans, grind them as finely as possible. Decaf has had all of its oils stripped out of it, and so provides very little resistance.

It's acknowledged in the paper that pulling coarser grinds probably results in a less subjectively pleasant extraction.
