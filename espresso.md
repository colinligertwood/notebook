# ESPRESSO

So I got a little carried away with this. I've only been pulling espresso for several months at the time of writing, so take all this with a grain of salt. That said, I like the coffee I'm pulling now, and it wasn't until I learned the things I'm writing about here. The following only works if you have fresh beans, a burr grinder, and are you're using a single-walled (non-pressurized) basket.

## DOSE

* Don't over-dose your basket. If the puck gets stuck to the filter-head when you remove the porta-filter, you've over-dosed. The top of a fully compressed puck should be about a quarter inch deep in the basket.
* Weigh your whole beans for every pull. I pull an 18 gram double, so I grind 18 grams of beans. My double basket wont fit much more than that.

## GRIND

* Tiny hard beans want to be ground finer. Large soft beans want to be ground coarser.
* Finer grinds can achieve more complex flavor, but coarser grinds pull more consistently, so find a balance.

## GROOMING & DISTRIBUTION

This is what you do to settle the coffee into the basket before tamping. It's very important to get this right in order to prevent channeling. Channeling will over/under extract your coffee at the same time, and it'll taste bad.

* Lightly groom the coffee into the portafilter to form a very loose puck.
* Gently bang the filled porta-filter down onto the counter, or into your palm a couple times to settle the coffee down into the basket. I do this onto a folded towel on the counter so I don't damage anything.
* Use a distribution tool to consistently distribute and level the top.

## TAMP
* Use a palm tamper for level tamps, but don't fret about pressure. Press hard enough to fully compress the puck.

## TIMING

* Over-extracted coffee tastes bitter and acrid. Under-extracted coffee tastes sour.
* Pull until the coffee starts to run blonde and the pour becomes erratic. This should take 20-35 seconds. If the coffee tastes bitter, stop even sooner.
* If the coffee runs blonde in less than 15 seconds, consider a finer grind.
* If your machine is chocking, and dripping, consider a coarser grind.

## Stir

* Give your espresso a quick stir before drinking to incorporate any grounds or bitter compounds trapped in the crema.

## MY OWN TIPS

* If you can manually control the timing of pre-infusion, pre-infuse until the coffee starts to pour smoothly.
* Stop the pull when the coffee turns blonde. If the coffee stream turns blonde, and the pour becomes erratic, there's no point in pulling any longer. You're just making it bitter.
* If you want to pull decaf beans, grind them as finely as possible. Decaf has had all of its oils stripped out of it.
