# Waffles

Yields some waffles

**Ingredients**

* 320g all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 4 large eggs, separated
* 25g sugar
* ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
* 60g margarine, melted
* 500g milk

**Method**

1. Preheat the waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. In one medium bowl sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
3. In a second bowl use the wooden spoon to beat together the egg yolks and sugar until sugar is completely dissolved and eggs have turned a pale yellow.
4. Add the vanilla extract, melted margarine, and milk to the eggs and whisk to combine.
5. Combine the egg-milk mixture with the flour mixture and whisk just until blended. Do not over mix.
6. In third bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until soft peaks form, about 1 minute.
7. Using the rubber spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the waffle batter. Do not overmix!
8. Grease the waffle iron and pour enough batter in iron to just cover waffle grid. Close and cook until jets of steam slow down. Serve immediately.
