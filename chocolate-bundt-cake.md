2. Grease your bundt pan with margarine and dust with sugar.
3. Stir together the margarine, coffee, salt, cocoa, and 1/2 cup of the sugar in a small saucepan on low heat until the butter melts and a smooth ganache forms. Cool for 10 minutes.
4. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the baking powder, and flour.
5. In a stand mixer, cream together the remaining sugar, 1 egg, 1 egg yolk, coconut milk, and vanilla, then add the chocolate mixture and mix thoroughly.
