# Colin's Amazing Fruit Cake

Yields one six cup bundt Cake

**For the fruit**

1 Cup Raisins
1/2 Cup Dried Figs
1/2 Cup Pitted Dates

**For the batter**

8 Tbsp Margarine
1 Cup Granulated Sugar
1 1/2 Tsp Baking Powder
1/2 Tsp Salt
1/2 Tsp Vanilla Extract
2 Eggs
2 Cups All Purpose Flour
1/2 Cup Orange Juice

**Method**

Prepare the dried fruit by chopping it up into small raisin sized pieces and soak in Amaro or Bourbon.

Prepare your bundt pan by greasing liberally with margarine and coating in granulated sugar.

Heat the oven to 325f.

Cream together the margarine and sugar, salt, baking powder, and vanilla.

Beat in the eggs one at a time.

Alternately the orange juice and flour, and mix just until combined, then fold in the dried fruits.

The result should be a very stiff pour batter.

Spoon the batter into your bundt pan and press it down so that it climbs up the sides of the pan.

Bake for 40-50 minutes.
