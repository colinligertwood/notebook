# Colin's Amazing Fruit Cake

Yields one six cup bundt Cake

**For the fruit**

1 Cup Raisins
1/2 Cup Dried Figs
1/2 Cup Pitted Dates

**For the batter**

8 Tbsp Margarine
1 Cup Granulated Sugar
1 1/2 Tsp Baking Powder
1/2 Tsp Salt
1/2 Tsp Cinnamon
1/2 Tsp Allspice
1/2 Tsp Vanilla Extract
2 Eggs
2 Cups All Purpose Flour
1/2 Cup Orange Juice

**Method**

Prepare the dried fruit by chopping it up into small raisin sized pieces and soak for a long time in Amaro, Bourbon, or Brandy.

Prepare your bundt pan by greasing liberally with margarine and coating in granulated sugar, and heat your oven to 325f.

In a stand mixer, cream together the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Add salt, baking powder, spices, and vanilla, then beat in the eggs one at a time.

Add the orange juice and flour, and mix just until combined, then fold in the dried fruits. The result should be a very stiff pour batter.

Spoon the batter into your bundt pan and press it down so that it climbs up the sides of the pan, and bake for 40-50 minutes or until it reaches an internal temperature of at least 190f or a butterknife comes out clean.

Let the cake cool for 5 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to cool. While it is still warm, finish the cake with a dusting of castor sugar or an orange glaze.
