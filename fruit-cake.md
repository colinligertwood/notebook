# Colin's Old Fashioned Fruit Cake

Yields one six cup bundt Cake

**For the fruit**

* 1 Cup Raisins
* 1/2 Cup Dried Figs
* 1/2 Cup Pitted Dates
* 1/4 Cup Amaro, Bourbon or Brandy

**For the batter**

* 1/2 Cup Margarine
* 1/2 Cup Demerara Sugar
* 1 1/2 Tsp Baking Powder
* 1 Tsp Cinnamon
* 1 Tsp Allspice
* 1/2 Tsp Salt
* 1/2 Tsp Vanilla Extract
* 2 Eggs
* 2 Cups All Purpose Flour
* 1/2 Cup Orange Juice

**Method**

Prepare the dried fruit by chopping it up into small raisin sized pieces and soak for a long time in Amaro, Bourbon, or Brandy.

Prepare your bundt pan by greasing liberally with margarine and coating in granulated sugar.

Heat your oven to 325f.

In a stand mixer, cream together the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Add salt, baking powder, spices, and vanilla, then beat in the eggs one at a time.

Add the orange juice and flour, and mix just until combined, then fold in the dried fruits. The result should be a very stiff pour batter.

Spoon the batter into your bundt pan and press it down so that it climbs up the sides of the pan. Bake for 50-60 minutes or until it reaches an internal temperature of at least 190f and a butterknife comes out clean.

Let the cake cool for 5 minutes in the pan before turning out.
