# Shortcrust Pastry

**Ingredients**

* 2 cups flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional)
* 3/4 cup margarine (180 grams)
* 1/3 cup (6 tablespoons) ice cold water

**Method**

1. Place flour in the processor bowl, salt and nutmeg and mix. 
2. Cut cold margarine into the flour.  
3. Pulse a few time, not more than 1 minute total until the margarine pieces are broken down into tiny bits and the mixture resembles breadcrumbs with some larger flecks or small chunks of margarine still visible. 
4. Start adding ice-cold water a little at a time, testing periodically. The dough should hold together, but not be sticky, stretchy, or wet.
5. Scrape the bowl and blades, give it a few more pulses and dump the crumbly dough onto a table. 
6. Press and push together until you get a smooth dough. 
7. Flatten dough to form a disc and put in a plastic wrap, this helps it chill faster. Put in the refrigerator to chill for one hour or more.
8. To roll out the dough, first press dough lightly with the rolling pin at the centre and roll outwards.
9. Roll in one direction a couple of times then lift it up and rotate a quarter turn and roll. Keep rolling and rotating till you get your desired thickness.
