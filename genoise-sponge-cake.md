# Genoise Sponge Cake

Yields one six-inch cake.

**Ingredients**

* 3 eggs, separated 
* 1tsp vanilla 
* 90g cake flour
* 90g caster sugar
* 1g salt
* 30g milk
* 30g light vegetable oil

**Method**

1. Heat oven to 350f, and line a 6 inch cake pan with parchment on the bottom and sides. Make sure the sides are at least 3 inches tall or cake will overflow as it bakes.
2. Beat egg yolks together with vanilla and set aside
3. In a stand mixer, whip egg whites, gradually adding all of the caster sugar until soft peaks form, and long ribbons can be pulled from the mixture.
4. Add the egg yolk mixture and whip just until combined.
5. Fold in the flour with a rubber spatula.
6. Mix a small amount of the egg mixture with all of the milk and oil, then fold it into the rest of the egg mixture.
7. Pour batter into the cake pan, sweep through the mixture with a thin skewer to remove any large bubbles, and give the pan a smack down onto the counter.
8. Bake for 35 minutes, or until a skewer comes out clean.

**Notes**

* As much as possible, do not open the oven or the cake will fall.
* Add 1/8 cup cocoa powder to the flour for a chocolate geroise.
