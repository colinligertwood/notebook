# Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies (Ricardo Cuisine)

Yields about two dozen cookies

*Ingredients*

- 1 1/2 cups (225 g) unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- Pinch salt  
- 3/4 cup (170 g) unsalted butter, melted
- 1 cup (210 g) brown sugar
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1 egg  
- 1 egg yolk
- 7 oz (195 g) milk or semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped

*Method*

1. With the rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line two or three baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a bowl, combine the flour, baking soda and salt.
3. In another bowl, combine the butter and both sugars with a wooden spoon. Add the eggs and stir until smooth. Stir in the dry ingredients and chocolate. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or overnight.
4. Using a 3-tbsp (45 ml) ice cream scoop, spoon five to six balls of dough on each baking sheet, spacing them out evenly.
5. Bake one sheet at a time for 8 to 9 minutes or until lightly browned all over. They will still be very soft in the centre. Cool completely on the baking sheet.
