**Method**

*For the pastry*

1. Sift together dry ingredients in a blow.
2. Add the margarine, and gently blend until the mixture resembles large bread crumbs.
3. Add half the cold water and continue blending together until a soft dough is formed.
4. If dough falls apart, gradually add more and more water until it holds together.

*For the pie*

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Place your crust in your pie pan. Place pie pan on a baking sheet.
3. Make pie filling. In a large bowl, by combining apples, flour, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, and salt. Pour into pie shell and shake a bit to let the apples settle.
4. Make the crumble topping. In a medium bowl, combine brown sugar, butter, oats, flour, and salt until well mixed and small crumbles form.
5. Carefully scoop or spoon the crumble topping over the apple pie.
6. Bake the pie at 350 degrees for 45-55 minutes, or until topping and crust is golden and the filling is bubbling. Allow to cool completely before cutting and serving.
