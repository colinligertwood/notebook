# Pancakes

A clone of Smitty's pancake mix. It's great.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup flour 
* 1 T. brown sugar 
* 1 t. baking powder 
* ½ t. baking soda
* ¼ t. salt
* 1 beaten egg
* 1 cup buttermilk
* 2 T. oil

## Method

1. Stir together dry ingredients. 
2. Mix wet ingredients and add to dry all at once. 
3. Stir just until blended. 
4. Add some regular milk if needed to thin batter. 
5. You can stir in whatever you want to, like blueberries or chocolate chips.
6. Cook on griddle or in fry pan on medium (300 on my griddle). 
7. When surface of pancake is bubbly and edges are getting dry, flip them. 
8. Serve with homemade maple syrup.

## Nodes

- This makes a lot of batter. To make pancakes for two, halve this recipe. If you're making scrambled eggs with breakfast, use about 25 grams of whisked egg in place of the 1 beaten egg.
