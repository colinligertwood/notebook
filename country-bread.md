# Country Bread

Yields one 700g batard

**Ingredients**

* 400g bread flour
* 300g warm water
* 8g salt
* 3g of instant yeast

**Method**

1. Sift the flour into a bowl and add 300 grams of the water. Combine into a thoroughly moist dough, cover with a wet towel, and let rest for 30 minutes.
3. Add the salt and yeast to the dough and pinch and kneed until to incorporate.
4. Kneed the dough by folding it over itself with a bench scraper for at least 15 minutes. Be careful no to tear the dough as you fold it. You're looking for a smooth sticky dough with a good windowpane test result.
5. Cover and leave in the oven with the light on for about 30 minutes, or until dough roughly doubles in size.
6. Shape the dough into a batard, and transfer into a banneton for final proving. I recommend doing the final prove in the fridge.
7. About 20 minutes before the bread has fully proved, place a cast iron dutch oven into the oven with the lid by its side, and heat to 450f.
8. Turn out the dough onto a piece of parchment paper, transfer into the hot dutch oven, and score.
9. Bake with the lid on for 15-20 minutes, then remove the lid and bake until a dark crust forms. About another 15 minutes.
10. Remove from the oven and cool on its side for at least an hour before cutting.

**Notes**

* If you are using dry active yeast, use up to 6 grams, and hydrate it with about 25 grams of the water.
* Substitute up to 150 grams of the white bread flour with whole wheat if desired.
* I have had best results when using Rogers bread flour and Rogers whole wheat bread flour.
* I've also used Robin Hood bread flour, and Flourist sifted red spring wheat flour. Both produced good loaves, and the Flourist red spring had a slightly better flavour and aroma.
* All Purpose flour works, but takes a lot more kneeding and more careful handling. Flatter and denser loaves should be expected.
* Sifting the bran out of whole wheat flour helps when blending with All Purpose flour. It's not necessary when using bread flour.
