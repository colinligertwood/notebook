# Colin's Delicious Country Loaf

Yields one 700g batard

**Ingredients**

* 400g bread flour
* 300g warm water
* 8g salt
* 5g active dry yeast, (or 3g of instant)

**Method**

2. Sift the flour into a bowl and add 260 grams of the water. Combine into a shaggy dough, cover, and leave to rest for 30 minutes.
3. About 15 minutes later dissolve the yeast to the remaining 40ml of the water and leave to hydrate.
4. Once the yeast has started to foam up, add it and the salt to the dough and pinch and kneed until it is fully incorporated.
5. Kneed the dough with a stand mixer, or by using the slap and fold method, for at least 15 minutes. You're looking for a good windowpane test result.
6. Cover and leave in the oven with the light on for about 30 minutes, or until dough roughly doubles in size.
7. Shape the dough into a batard, and transfer into a banneton for final proving. I recommend doing the final prove in the fridge.
8. About 20 minutes before the bread has fully proved, place a cast iron dutch oven into the oven with the lid by its side, and heat to 450f.
9. Turn out the dough onto a piece of parchment paper, transfer into the hot dutch oven, and score.
10. Bake with the lid on for 15 minutes, then remove the lid and bake until a dark crust forms. About another 15 minutes.
11. Remove from the oven and cool on its side for at least an hour before cutting.
