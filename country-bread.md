# Country Bread

Yields one 700g batard

**Ingredients**

* 400g bread flour
* 300g warm water
* 8g salt
* 3g of instant yeast

**Method**

1. Combine flour, water, salt, and yeast in a stand mixer, and mix with the dough hook until a smooth dough is achieved, and the sides of the bowl are clean. About 10 minutes.
2. Place dough into a covered bowl or pot, and leave in the oven with the light on for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
3. Shape, and place the dough into banneton, or towel lined bowl. Cover with a damp towel, and leave for a second prove.
4. Place a dutch oven in the oven and heat to 475f.
5. Once final prove is complete, turn out the dough onto a small sheet of baking parchment. Score, and transfer into the dutch oven.
6. Reduce the oven to 400f, and bake for 15-20 minutes. 

**Notes**

* If you are using dry active yeast, use up to 6 grams, and hydrate it with about 25 grams of the water.
* Substitute up to 150 grams of the white bread flour with whole wheat if desired.
* I have had best results when using Rogers bread flour and Rogers whole wheat bread flour.
* I've also used Robin Hood bread flour, and Flourist sifted red spring wheat flour. Both produced good loaves, and the Flourist red spring had a slightly better flavour and aroma.
* All Purpose flour works, but takes a lot more kneeding and more careful handling. Flatter and denser loaves should be expected.
* Sifting the bran out of whole wheat flour helps when blending with All Purpose flour. It's not necessary when using bread flour.
* If your loaves come out with a charred bottom, reduce oven heat. If the issue persists, reduce bake time.
* Removing the lid of the pot after about 10 minutes will promote crust browning.
