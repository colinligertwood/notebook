# Date Squares

**Ingredients**

*For the filling*

* 400g Pitted dates
* 1 cup water
* 2 tbsp lemon juice
* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp baking soda

*For the crumble*

* 175g quick-cooking oats
* 150g unbleached all-purpose flour
* 160g brown sugar
* 1/4 tsp baking powder
* 170g margarine

**Method**

1. With the rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 350 °F (180 °C). Line a 20-cm (8-inch) square baking dish with a strip of parchment paper, letting it hang over both sides. Butter the other two sides.
2. In a pot, bring the dates, water, lemon juice, and brown sugar to a boil. Add the baking soda and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, or until the dates have fallen apart. Let cool.
3. In a bowl, combine the oats, flour, brown sugar, and baking powder. Add the butter and stir to combine.
4. Spread half the crumble in the baking dish and press firmly. Layer with the date mixture. Cover with the remaining crumble and press lightly.
5. Bake for 55 minutes or until the crumble is golden brown. Let cool on a wire rack for 4 hours.
