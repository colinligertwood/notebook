# Butter Cake

Yields two 6 inch round cakes.

**Ingredients**

* 285g All purpose flour.
* 4g Baking powder.
* 2g Table salt.
* 3/4 Cups Margarine.
* 185g Granulated sugar.
* 3 eggs.
* 1/2 Cup Milk.
* 1 1/2 Tsp Vanilla extract.

**Method**

1. With the rack in middle position, preheat the oven to 180 °C (350 °F). Grease two 6 inch round cake tins and line with paper on the bottom.
2. In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
3. In another bowl, cream the butter with the sugar and vanilla with an electric mixer. Add the eggs one at a time, beating until the mixture is smooth. Add the dry ingredients alternately with the milk. Scoop the batter into the pans, and level the top.
4. Bake for approximately 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the centre of the cake comes out mostly clean.

**Notes**

- It's easy to make this batter too stiff, resulting in a dry cake. If the batter doesn't fall easily from your spoon, add a little more milk.
- I'm using Imperial Margarine bricks and Oat milk.
