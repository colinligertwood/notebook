# Shortbread cookies or crust

This recipe makes a basic shortbread that is salty, buttery, and can bake down to a crisp biscuit.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup all purpose flour.
* 1/2 cup margarine or butter.
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar.
* 3/4 tsp table salt.

## Method

* Place all ingredients in a food processor, and whiz until a fine breadcrumb texture is achieved.
* For biscuits:
  * Press into a solid dough between two sheets of parchment with two breadboards, or roll out on a single sheet.
  * Cut into shapes, and punch a small hole out of the center to prevent the center of the biscuit lifting off the sheet while baking.
  * Bake at 325 for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges brown slightly.
* For tart crust:
  * Press into the bottom and sides of a false bottomed tart pan. The thinner the better.
  * Spread out a crumpled up sheet of parchment into the shell, and fill with baking beans, or dried beans. Blind bake at 325 for 25 minutes, occasionally peeling away the paper to see progress. Bake until the bottom browns slightly.
